How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    by checking line by line i found the difference b/w two versions

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?


    we can find the changes in the project right from begining using history

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    manually commit is best because we can make changes and after making them we
    can undo and redo them and we can commit when we want.automatic saving is like
    what chages you do it'll save for every change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    if we want to use multiple files and its better to save in one commit .

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log is used to see the commits applied
    and git diff is used to see the changes applied in two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    it's not a problem if the chages make big mistake or break something we can
    go back to previous version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    to check the versions and commits changes applied to it
